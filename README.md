State Map_Visualization
State Map with Attribute Density Visualization (Python) 
This Python code generates a choropleth map of anay countery (E.g Sudan), visualizing the density of a specific attribute across its states. Users can provide data about each state (ID, value) and a GeoJSON file containing  conunery (Sudan)'s administrative boundaries.  

Functionality: 
Leverages the Folium library to create an interactive map. 
Uses a GeoJSON file to define the state boundaries. 
Assigns colors to states based on the provided attribute values.  

Requirements: 
Python 3 (tested with 3.x) 
Folium library (pip install folium)  
input: 
CSV/JSON file contains  data about each state (ID, value) 

output:
State Map with Attribute Density Visualization as HTML file
